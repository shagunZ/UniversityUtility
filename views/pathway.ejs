                  <p class="card-text">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
                    code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
                    It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

                  <p class="card-text">C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                    C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                    C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                    C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                    C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>
