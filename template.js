        comment: "programming is a tool to solve problems. Now, to solve a problem, you need to actually THINK about it. You think about how to approach a problem. What are we expecting from this problem when it is solved? Such questions come to our mind. Once you figure out how to solve the problem, you actually sit and CODE it. So in short, PROGRAMMING is 80% THINKING and 20% CODING."

However, React specializes in creating UI components and can be used in any application, including single-page apps."
